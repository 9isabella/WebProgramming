# Tuesday, January 22nd: HTTP
* PSA on sexual harassment
* Last class: the big ideas?
* Recall telephone conversation example
* Telephone extension numbers
* So what is the web?
* Two special computers: web server and web client
* URLs:
  `protocol://domain/<any directories here>/<filename>`
* The big idea of HTTP, how the web works: request-response, similar to Q&A
* Examining HTTP requests and responses on Reddit...
* HTTP commands: GET and POST
  - GET: Download data
  - POST: Upload data, send data to web server
  
# Thursday, January 24th: HTML
* Last class: recall how HTTP works
* Recall question: if no port number is provided, the default port number to connect to on web server is...?
* Recall question: what HTTP command is executed when entering URL address?
* Q: How to browse web without web browser?
* Demo: Web server
* Recall question: if no file is provided in URL, the file with what name is generally served by default?
* Take a look at the HTML
* What is markup?
  - The paragraph analogy
* Motivation: writing
* Block vs. inline elements
* Attributes
* Image --a special tag...
* Anchors
* Absolute vs relative URLs
* W3C validator

# Tuesday, January 29th: Revision Control with Git
* Recall: block elements, absolute vs relative sources, W3C validator, example
* What's wrong with the HTML?
* What I've noticed in the past: many connecting to Tufts CS to do work via SSH, questions on submitting assignments and labs in this class, how to upload web pages to a server
* The nightmare scenario that illustrates the need for revision control: in the past...
* What if I need to hire developers to work on different pieces of a projet?
* Why revision control? Keep track of changes, document changes
* Why Git? Speed, no dependency of a remote server (unlike Subversion)
* Why GitHub for repositories? Network effect, communications
* Example with our course website
* IMPORTANT: you are not expected to master Git by the end of this course.  The reality, even for the most seasoned people: https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/707327952158121984

# Thursday, January 31st: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* Why do you want to separate style?
* One CSS _rule_ is made up of _selectors_ and _declarations_. A declaration is a _property-value_ pair.
  - You really want to refer to a CSS cheat sheet!
* Three types of selectors: HTML tag names, ID, class
  - ID: should only be used once; starts with "#"
  - class: can be used many times; start with "."
  - Mixing IDs and classes is confusing, generally not a good idea.
  - "id" and "class" attribute exist for all HTML elements
  - Generic block HTML element: div
  - Generic inline HTML element: span
* Box model for HTML body elements
* The "cascading" in "cascading style sheet"
  - What if there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?
